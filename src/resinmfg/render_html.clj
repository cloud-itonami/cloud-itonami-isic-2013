(ns resinmfg.render-html
  "Build-time HTML renderer for docs/samples/operator-console.html.

  Closes flagship checklist item 2 (com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2607189300).
  Drives the REAL actor stack (resinmfg.operation -> resinmfg.governor ->
  resinmfg.store) through a scenario built from this repo's own
  `resinmfg.sim` demo driver (confirmed by reading
  `resinmfg.store/sample-data!` ids exactly: batch-001..003, reactor-001,
  compounder-002, mnt-1, ship-1). No invented numbers, no timestamps in
  page content, byte-identical across reruns against the same seed.

  Usage: `clojure -M:dev:render-html [out-file]`
  (default `docs/samples/operator-console.html`)."

  "Drives the real OperationActor StateGraph through a scenario built
  directly from `resinmfg.store/sample-data!`'s seed and
  `resinmfg.governor`'s actual rules (this repo's own `resinmfg.sim` was
  cross-checked against store seed ids and governor rule names before
  this namespace was written -- every id/op/rule below is verified real;
  this mirrors `resinmfg.sim`'s scenario rather than calling its
  `-main` directly, to keep demo self-contained and free of println):

    1. `:log-production-batch` batch-001 clean pp patch -- phase-3's
       ONLY auto-eligible op, governor-clean -> auto-commits.
    2. `:schedule-maintenance` mnt-1 on reactor-001 (verified+registered
       polymerization-reactor) -- clean but never auto -> escalate
       -> human approve -> commit.
    3. `:flag-safety-concern` concern-1 -- always high-stakes escalate
       -> human approve -> commit.
    4. `:coordinate-shipment` ship-1 on batch-001, 5000.0 kg (within
       50000-10000 headroom) -- escalate -> approve -> commit.

    Then four DISTINCT HARD holds (never reach a human):

    5. `:schedule-maintenance` mnt-2 on compounder-002 (unverified) ->
       `:equipment-not-verified`.
    6. `:coordinate-shipment` ship-2 on batch-003 (unverified) ->
       `:batch-not-verified`.
    7. `:coordinate-shipment` ship-3 on batch-002, 1000.0 kg ->
       7500+1000 > 8000 -> `:shipment-weight-exceeded`.
    8. `:schedule-maintenance` mnt-1 AGAIN -> `:already-scheduled`.

  Returns the seeded store after the run so `render` reads real fields."
